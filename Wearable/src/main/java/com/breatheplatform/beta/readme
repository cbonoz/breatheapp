Breathe Asthma Watch App

Workflow:
1. Register the cliniciation username (email) and paired subjects on the breathe server.
2. Give the clinician user their subject ID(s) with the watch so they can initialize the app correctly
    (they will say their number on the very first login only)
3. Only watch is required for app to run. Watch will provide watch face

User can relaunch the UI-based registration process on the mobile device by clicking the "Breathe Registration"
app icon

Note: WEARABLE is in charge of the bluetooth connections, as we don't assume the user will have their phone
in proximity all day. Phone operates as a data transmitter to the server. Wearable is the initial data collector.

Wearable must be paired to both the desired phone, spirometer, and dust sensors before use (for security reasons).
To check your currently paired devices on the watch, can go to settings -> bluetooth
on the wearable and select Unpair Devices. Swipe right once finished. Can pair devices from the bluetooth page.
