Breathe Asthma Watch App

Workflow:
1. Register the username manually on the breathe server and record ID for that individual.
2. Give user their ID number with the watch so they can initialize the app correctly
    (they will say their number on the very first login only)
3. Only watch is required for app to run. Watch will provide watch face

Currently working on implementing a UI-based registration process on the mobile device.

Wearable must be paired to both the desired phone, spirometer, and dust sensor before use.
