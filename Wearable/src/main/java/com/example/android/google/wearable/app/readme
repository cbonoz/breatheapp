Breathe Asthma Watch App

Workflow:
1. Register the username manually on the breathe server and record ID for that individual.
2. Give user their ID number with the watch so they can initialize the app correctly
    (they will say their number on the very first login only)
3. Only watch is required for app to run. Watch will provide watch face

Observation:
watch still needs phone in order to use fused location api (probably because wifi routed through phone)
if phone is on, requests don't get through (still need to fix this)

Currently working on converting UI to watchfaceonly - some challenges:
1. How to accept initial user input to register the user id for the first time. No way to trigger
 startActivityForResult method for launching google services voice recognition screen. This is the
 biggest one - the alternative to having th euser say their login for the very first time is to
 have one of us configure the user id ahead of time before we give them the watch (which may be a good idea).
 2. Need to be able to regulate sensors on and off from the watchface activity.
 3. Not a whole lot of options for creating interactive elements - easy to close. Need a way to be able to use spirometer data as well.
