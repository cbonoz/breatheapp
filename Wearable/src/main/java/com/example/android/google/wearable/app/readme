Breathe Asthma Watch App

Workflow:
1. Register the username manually on the breathe server and record ID for that individual.
2. Give user their ID number with the watch so they can initialize the app correctly
    (they will say their number on the very first login only)
3. Only watch is required for app to run. Watch will provide watch face

Observation:
watch still needs phone in order to use fused location api (probably because wifi routed through phone)
if phone is on, requests don't get through (still need to fix this)
