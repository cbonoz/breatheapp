Project Notes

Shared Library Creation:

You can create a new "Android Library" Module in the project, and place your common classes there.

Then you simply add it as a dependency of both the Mobile and Wear modules (in Project Structure ->
Dependencies -> Add -> Module dependency). That way you can create/use instances of these classes
from both modules.
