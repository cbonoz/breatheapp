The BTDustSensor class works independently of mobile or wearable platform (as long as the device has bluetooth).

This class contains the logic for both connecting to local/live bluetooth dust sensors in the vicinity
(via Bluetooth LE), receiving data, and forwarding that data onto the server for parsing.
